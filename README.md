# Does engagement matter: Do mice see the world differently when they don't care?

The following repository contains code for the Project for Neuromatch Academy: Computational Neuroscience.

Traditionally V1/VISp is considered a simple feature detector. Stimulus representation in A1 is known to adapt to engagement in a go/no-go task. Does stimulus representation in V1 also differ depending on engagement (active) and disengagement (passive)? We investigate this question both cell-level and population-level.

## Requirements

Required Python packages are listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
The dataset can be accessed from the following [allen-sdk api](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_behavior_optical_physiology.html).

## Results 

- On single cell level our methods yield no clear results.
- Population level dissimilarity (RDM) hints at the difference between active and passive  session, but with control (pre-stimuli) this difference appears independent of the stimuli.

Refer to the respective notebooks for [single cell](single_cell_analysis.ipynb) and [population level analysis](population_analysis.ipynb). For detailed results, refer to the [presentation file](NMA-2021-AwareWolfs.pdf).
